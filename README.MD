# Source code for Poe-Query

Hey, because some people asked me to publish the code behind https://poe-query.now.sh - here it is.

~~It's working quite good~~ (sadly because of API changes it isn't working anymore. You need auth now which won't work in my case). The page is looking awful though. The Api-Code uses a hacky solution, I don't quite like it but it solves the problem. If you have any improvements, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
